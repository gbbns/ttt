This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Status

Data is retrieve from API call successfully, and each item is clickable.

Next steps would be to connect the pagination and search to the two relevant API end points.

There are a few CSS tweaks I'd like to have made, but, time was a factor.
